# 🏏 IPL Auction Prediction Project


## overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting IPL Runs of players.  
It includes:
- Scrapping
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Regression models (Linear, Polynomial, Decision Tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting)  
- Hyperparameter tuning gridsearchCV 
- Model deployment with Streamlit
